Download an authenticator app:\n   - Google Authenticator (iOS/Android)\n   - Microsoft Authenticator (iOS/Android)\n   - Authy (iOS/Android/Desktop)\n   - 1Password (if you use it for passwords)\n\n2. In our app, go to Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication\n3. Click 'Enable 2FA'\n4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app\n5. Enter the 6-digit code from your app to verify\n6. **IMPORTANT**: Save the backup codes in a secure location\n\n### Using SMS (Less Secure)\n\n1. Go to Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication\n2. Select 'SMS' as your method\n3. Enter your phone number\n4. Verify with the code sent to your phone\n\n## Using 2FA to Login\n\n1. Enter your email and password as usual\n2. When prompted, enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app\n3. Codes refresh every 30 seconds\n\n## Backup Codes\n\n- You receive 10 backup codes when setting up 2FA\n- Each code can only be used once\n- Store them safely (password manager, printed in secure location)\n- Generate new codes if you run out\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Codes Not Working / Being Rejected\n- Ensure your phone's time is synced automatically (Settings > Date & Time > Automatic)\n- Make sure you're using the correct account in your authenticator\n- Try the next code (they change every 30 seconds)\n- Check if you're looking at the right service entry in the app\n- Time zone differences can cause issues - ensure automatic time sync\n\n### Lost Access to Authenticator\n1. Use a backup code to login\n2. Go to Settings > Security\n3. Disable and re-enable 2FA with new device\n\n### Lost Phone / New Phone\n1. If you have backup codes, use one to login\n2. Go to Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication\n3. Click 'Reset 2FA' and set up on new device\n4. If no backup codes, contact support with identity verification\n\n### Lost Backup Codes\n- If you can still login, generate new backup codes in Settings\n- If locked out, contact support with identity verification\n- You'll need to verify identity via government ID or other means",

Verify database host and port\n2. Check firewall rules (allow port 5432 for PostgreSQL, 3306 for MySQL)\n3. Test connectivity: `telnet <host> <port>`\n4. Check database server logs\n5. Increase connection timeout in settings\n\n### Authentication Failed\n**Error:** `password authentication failed for user`\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Verify username and password\n2. Check pg_hba.conf (PostgreSQL) for allowed authentication methods\n3. Reset database password\n4. Ensure user has login privilege\n\n### SSL Connection Required\n**Error:** `SSL connection is required`\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Enable SSL in connection settings\n2. Provide SSL certificate if required\n3. Set `sslmode=require` in connection string\n\n### Too Many Connections\n**Error:** `too many connections for role`\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Check current connections: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity`\n2. Increase max_connections in database config\n3. Use connection pooling (PgBouncer, HikariCP)\n4. Close idle connections\n\n## Connection Pooling\n\n### Best Practices\n- Use connection pooling for production\n- Set pool size = CPU cores × 2 + 1\n- Configure idle timeout (300s recommended)\n- Enable connection validation\n- Monitor pool utilization\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Slow Queries\n1. Enable query logging\n2. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to check query plans\n3. Add appropriate indexes\n4. Optimize N+1 query patterns\n5. Use database monitoring tools\n\n### Connection Latency\n- Use connection pooling to avoid reconnection overhead\n- Place application server close to database\n- Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads\n- Consider connection multiplexing",
